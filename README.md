# T2T-Great-Ape-Diversity
## We perform comprehensive genomic analyses utilizing Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) assembly reference genomes for five great ape species, including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, Sumatran orangutans, and Bornean orangutans. Our findings reveal the significant potential of T2T reference genomes in facilitating more accurate and detailed genomic and functional analyses of great ape species.
