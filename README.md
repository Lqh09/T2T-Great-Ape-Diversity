# T2T-Great-Ape-Diversity
## Project Overview
This project utilizes Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) assembly reference genomes to perform comprehensive genomic analyses for five great ape species: gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos, Sumatran orangutans, and Bornean orangutans. Our findings reveal the great potential of T2T reference genomes in facilitating more accurate and detailed genomic and functional analyses of great ape species.
